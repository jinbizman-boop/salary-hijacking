# Mobile UI/UX Reference

This document connects the user-provided Salary Hijacking design references to
the current mobile app implementation. Use it before changing launch screens,
bottom tabs, Clean Fintech components, store screenshots, brand assets, or
mobile UI copy.

## Verified Design Intent

The Salary Hijacking app is a mobile-first finance and self-development product
that helps users separate payroll, fixed expenses, savings, living money, and
daily spending right after payday. The central value message is not "expense
tracking" but "how much money the user protected."

The launch UI direction is `Salary Hijacking Clean Fintech v1`:

- Use a clear green fintech identity built around `#209252`.
- Show the user value first: `이번 달 내가 지켜낸 돈`.
- Keep the home screen understandable within a few seconds: protected money,
  daily remaining budget, this-month hijack amount, and next payday.
- Convert dense tables into readable cards and compact rows on mobile.
- Keep community and LV UP friendly, routine-oriented, and lightweight.
- Keep ads and partners below core financial information and label them as
  `제휴/광고`.
- Never place raw salary, expense, savings, hijack amount, account, card, loan,
  email, phone, token, push token, or raw device identifier into ads, analytics,
  logs, push payloads, or partner targeting.

## Validation Contract

When changing the mobile UI reference or Clean Fintech UI, run the closest
available checks:

```powershell
corepack pnpm --filter @salary-hijacking/mobile test -- clean-fintech-theme.test.ts
corepack pnpm --filter @salary-hijacking/mobile typecheck
corepack pnpm --filter @salary-hijacking/mobile format:check
corepack pnpm run format:check
corepack pnpm run check:release-readiness -- --soft
git diff --check
```

Use `Get-Content -Encoding UTF8` or `rg` when inspecting Korean source files in
Windows PowerShell. Plain `Get-Content` can display valid UTF-8 Korean as
mojibake on some shells.

## Current Limits

This document verifies local UI reference mapping and static mobile contract
coverage. It is not proof of production readiness. Project-wide operational
completion still requires native EAS builds, native E2E, store submission
dry-runs, production API/DB smoke tests, Cloudflare resource proof, runtime
secret proof, and release QA.
